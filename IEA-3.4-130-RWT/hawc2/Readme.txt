This folder contains the HAWC2 model for the IEA 3.4MW reference turbine convert by DTU Wind Energy:

Note:
The htc file 'IEA_3.4MW_master_RWT.htc' in ./htc/_master/ folder can not be used for hawc2 simulation directly.
It is the "master" htc file used by "DTU Wind Energy Toolbox" to generator htc-files for different DLC cases.


Changing log:

2020-01-20: the first version of the HAWC2 model based on the IEA 3.4MW turbine;
2020-04-28: The non-structure mass is added and this is considered as the final version of the HAWC2 model 
            for the IEA 3.4MW turbine;
2021-02-19: Added one example htc-file in which all the tags are replaced by the parameters needed for dlc1.2 at 11 m/s.
